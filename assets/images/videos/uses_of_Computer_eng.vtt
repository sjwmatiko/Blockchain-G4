00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.359
In ancient times, we had no computers.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.939
It was very difficult to perform different tasks.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.939
In banks, manual money calculations and auditing

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.500
would take long time.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.100
to prepare report cards and test papers.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.739
Architects would take time in building their designs,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.620
drafting their designs for projects.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.739

Now architects also use computers for mapping and designing

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.960
which helps them to work faster.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.340

Now I will tell you about the places where computers are used.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.079
In schools, computer trainings are provided to the students.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.960
which included Microsoft Excel, paint, typing speed and many other topics.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.400
Students learn through power point presentation.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.279
In library, computers are used to search

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.080
the meaning of different vocabularies on google.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.700
In railways, computers are used for booking tickets.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.939
It is also used to display the scheduled

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.640
arrival and departure timings of the trains.

00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:02.095
The controlling and monitoring process of the trains

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.479
arrival and departure are done with the help of computers.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.300
The information of the trains are displayed on the screens.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.579
In hospitals also computers and technology related to computers

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.179
is used vastly to maintain data of patients.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.819
Utilize computerized equipments to observe a patient's health condition.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.079
With the help of computers doctors get information of heart related issue of the patient.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.639
It also used to find out mental illness of the patient.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.319
This way computers are used for various purposes in hospitals.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.859
In offices, computers are used while conducting a meeting

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.060
for recording datas and to maintain official records.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.800
In banks, computers are used to keep details of customer's bank account.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.180

for exploring information from the internet,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.160
watching movies, playing games and for various other purposes.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.559

high level of editing and graphics to enhance the quality of the movie.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.200
This is done through computers.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.840
Computers are used in gathering information regarding weather forecast.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:48.080
It helps in controlling satellites and doing space research work.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.260
Connections with satellite is possible with the help of computers.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.359
Police can catch the violators of the traffic rules and criminals

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.400
with the help of computers and CCTV cameras.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.060
I have shared with you the various uses of computers.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.919
I hope you all children are interested in learning this.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.699
This will help you to grow in future.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.620
